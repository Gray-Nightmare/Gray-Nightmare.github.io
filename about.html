    <p>I really enjoy coding things (like this website)! I also spend a lot of time speedrunning video games, specifically Hollow Knight: Silksong, which I was just able to beat in 1:25:10. Along with that, I am thinking about learning to TAS (tool assisted speedrun) the game or learn how to create mods. I also have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GrayNtmr">YouTube channel!</a></p>
